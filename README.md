# Towe-of-Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle involving three pegs and a set of disks of varying sizes. The disks start on one peg, arranged in size with the smallest on top.
The goal is to move the stack to another peg, following these rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, and no disk may be placed on top of a smaller one.
